# snowflake-generator
Makes SVG snowflakes in a web page.

## Inspiration
[Episode 1 of the BBC's Forces of Nature with Brian Cox](http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b07k7m4z/forces-of-nature-with-brian-cox-1-the-universe-in-a-snowflake), which covered the formation process of snowflakes, and the origin of their sixfold symmetry.

## Prototype
The [working prototype](http://www.sleepingdog.org.uk/svg/nature/snowflake/snowflakes.html) has had limited testing and lacks envisioned final functionality.
